# Tableau_Dashboard_On_Stock_Prices
This project showcases an advanced Tableau dashboard (file attached) analyzing historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance. The dashboard includes a candlestick chart, which is a popular technique for visualizing stock price movements over time.

The project demonstrates the use of advanced visualization techniques in Tableau to explore financial market trends, highlight key insights, and provide a coherent economic narrative. The candlestick and line chart effectively showcases opening, closing, high, and low prices and volumne of shares offering a comprehensive view of stock performance.

I choose Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Kroger (KR) stocks to examine how these retail stores are doing financially.
